# Visualization with Python

This project focuses on developing data visualization skills using Python. The goal was to reproduce a given sample plot based on a dataset using appropriate plotting tools.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Visualization_with_Python.ipynb` — main notebook with the visualization code
- `squirrel_diet.csv` — dataset used for the visualization
- `example_plot.png` — reference image for the expected output
- `my_plot.png` — the resulting plot produced using Python

## 🎯 Objectives

- Recreate a specific data visualization based on a reference image
- Practice using `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for custom visualizations
- Match the visual style, structure, and content of the reference chart as closely as possible

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## ✅ Outcome

The resulting plot successfully replicates the original example in both appearance and structure. The project demonstrates proficiency in customizing plot elements such as labels, colors, axes, and legends to match a target design.
